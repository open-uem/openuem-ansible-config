# Ansible Configuration File Generator

This repository contains a library that can help to create Ansible playbooks

This library is used by OpenUEM to generate the configuration files that contains the desired state expressed by the admin in the OpenUEM console and are executed by OpenUEM agents.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: This library is not considered ready to use, it's a Proof of Concept and a WIP
